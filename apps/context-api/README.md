# Context API

This ASGI service is the sole authoritative writer for workload manifests. It exposes idempotent,
optimistically concurrent draft, validation, review, human approval, publication, supersession,
comparison, and audit operations.

The default composition root intentionally rejects every credential and has no grants. A
deployment must inject an authentication port that verifies Entra/JWT credentials before returning
typed actor claims, plus manifest-scoped role grants. `X-Athena-Actor` and other caller-supplied
identity assertions are never trusted. Agent actors are denied approval, publication, and
supersession even if they are accidentally granted a privileged role.

Published manifest values are immutable. Supersession is stored as a separate append-only relation.
Submission replaces untrusted draft audit values with a server-finalized publication candidate and
recomputes canonical digests. Human approval binds that exact candidate; publication does not
mutate it.

## Cohort proposal routes

- `GET /v1/cohort-proposals` resolves one exact active draft/profile binding, retrieves an
  immutable workload-scoped snapshot through a typed repository port, cryptographically verifies
  it through the trusted verifier port, and returns the bounded WC-010 batch with `sourceDraft`.
- `POST /v1/cohort-proposals/preview` accepts only exact split/merge bindings and returns
  deterministic selector-only candidates. It never mutates a manifest, validates a draft,
  approves, or publishes.

Both routes require a verified human identity and a concrete workload grant; wildcard grants do
not cross this boundary. Deployments must inject the snapshot repository, cryptographic verifier,
immutable proposal cache, and actor-scoped idempotency receipt ports. The default composition
contains no evidence and grants no access.
