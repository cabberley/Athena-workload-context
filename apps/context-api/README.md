# Context API

This ASGI service is the sole authoritative writer for workload manifests. It exposes idempotent,
optimistically concurrent draft, validation, review, human approval, publication, supersession,
comparison, and audit operations.

The default composition root intentionally rejects every credential and has no grants. A
deployment must inject an authentication port that verifies Entra/JWT credentials before returning
typed actor claims, plus manifest-scoped role grants. `X-Athena-Actor` and other caller-supplied
identity assertions are never trusted. Agent actors are denied approval, publication, and
supersession even if they are accidentally granted a privileged role.

Published manifest values are immutable. Supersession is stored as a separate append-only relation.
Submission replaces untrusted draft audit values with a server-finalized publication candidate and
recomputes canonical digests. Human approval binds that exact candidate; publication does not
mutate it.
